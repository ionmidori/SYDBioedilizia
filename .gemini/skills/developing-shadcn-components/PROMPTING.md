# AI Steering for Shadcn (v0.dev Best Practices)

To get professional results from AI generators like v0.dev or Antigravity, you must use **Technical Steering**.

## The Prompt Layering Method

### Layer 1: The Functional Goal
"Create a dark-themed analytics dashboard for a renovation company."

### Layer 2: Visual Style (The "WOW" Factor)
"Use a **Bento Grid** layout. Apply **Glassmorphism** with `bg-white/5` and `backdrop-blur-xl`. Use **indigo-500** as the primary accent color."

### Layer 3: Technical Constraints
"Use **Shadcn/UI components** only. Use **Lucide React** for icons. Ensure all cards have a `border-white/10`. Use **Framer Motion** for entrance animations."

## Steering Tokens
Include these specific terms in your prompts to trigger high-end results:
- **"High-density"**: For professional admin panels.
- **"Minimalist"**: For sleek landing pages.
- **"Semantic colors"**: To ensure the AI uses your design system variables.
- **"Lucide Pro"**: For consistent iconography.

## Troubleshooting AI Code
If the AI output is "too simple":
- **Command**: *"Increase visual complexity using nested gradients and subtle border strokes."*
- **Command**: *"Refactor this into a more asymmetrical bento layout with 4 columns."*
