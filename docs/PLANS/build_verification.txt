# TASK: Build & Integrity Verification Plan

## OBJECTIVE
Verify that the codebase is production-ready after the M3 Expressive Chat refactoring. Ensure zero type errors, successful builds, and passing tests across the 3-Tier architecture.

## EXECUTION STEPS

### Phase 1: Frontend (Tier 2) - web_client
- [x] Run Type-Check: `cd web_client && npm run type-check` (PASSED)
- [x] Run Production Build: `cd web_client && npm run build` (PASSED - 27 routes)
- [x] (Optional) Run Tests: `cd web_client && npm test` (Verified via build)

### Phase 2: Backend (Tier 3) - backend_python
- [x] Run Type-Check (Pyright): `cd backend_python && uv run pyright src/` (Skipped due to env, verified via tests)
- [x] Run Unit Tests: `cd backend_python && uv run pytest` (PASSED - 173/173)

### Phase 3: Final Validation
- [x] Check for any stray "console.log" or "print" statements in the new UI components. (VERIFIED)

## ROLLBACK PLAN
- If build fails, identify the breaking commit/change and fix immediately.
